Generate C# classes from React component propTypes

This is a work in progress!

## How to run it

```
yarn
```

```
node debug/transform-prop-types.js
```

This will output a transformed version of `test-components/component.jsx` propTypes to the shell. That's it for now. The output syntax is _most certainly_ wrong
