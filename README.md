# PropTypes C# Webpack Plugin

A Webpack plugin that generates C# classes from React component propTypes

This is a work in progress!

## Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Run

### Webpack plugin

```
yarn build
```

This will run webpack and write `.cs` files to `dist/classes`.

### Transform script

```
yarn transform
```

This will output the C# class for `fixtures/func-component.jsx` to the shell
